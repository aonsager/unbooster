# Un-booster

A simple script to un-boost statuses that were boosted more than one week ago.
Assumed to be run daily via cron.

## Motivation

My usage of boosting was stuck in a mindset that is a remnant of Twitter's culture. Since these status are displayed on my timeline next to my own words, I find myself boosting statuses that resonate strongly with my own thoughts. Had I been the one to think of these words first, I may have been the posting instead.

On Mastodon and the fediverse, my understanding is that the recommended usage of boosting is to increase visibility to statuses that you think should be seen. This has noting to do with whether they specifically mirror my own thoughts. 

At the same time I don't want my timeline to be filled with other people's words, so my solution is to automatically un-boost statuses after one week. After the initial boost of visibility, there shouldn't be a reason to have them stuck on my timeline forever. The aim is that this will give me the freedom to boost more widely, and not worry about diluting my own words.
